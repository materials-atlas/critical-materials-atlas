"""Record what every builder ACTUALLY reads and writes. Phase 1 of ARCHITECTURE.md.

WHY OBSERVED AND NOT DECLARED
Two independent reviewers said the dependency rules in ARCHITECTURE.md could not be enforced,
because a hand-written manifest always misses an edge: a glob, a path built from a variable, a
pandas call that opens its file in C rather than through Python. They are right about DECLARED
manifests, and that objection has killed this idea in other projects.

It mostly does not apply here. sys.addaudithook fires on every file access that goes through
CPython's own open() - measured against pandas.read_parquet, zipfile and json/open before this file
was written. So nobody writes the graph down, and nobody can forget to.

WHERE THAT CLAIM WAS TOO STRONG, AND WHAT IT COST
"Including from compiled extensions" is what this file used to say, and it is false. A C library
that does its own I/O never calls CPython's open() and the hook never fires. Found on 11 Sep by
building the register's `read_by` column out of this graph and noticing that raw/maus and raw/sepin
- 122 MB of mining-footprint polygons that two builders demonstrably read - had no reader at all.

  sqlite3   raises its OWN audit event, "sqlite3.connect", and no "open". Three builders read
            GeoPackages (which are SQLite files) through it, and all three edges were missing.
            Fixed below by listening for that event: complete, and as cheap as the rest.
  duckdb    raises NOTHING identifiable. It fires "open" for its own libraries and never for the
            parquet it reads or writes - measured directly, not assumed. Worse, the obvious repair
            does not work either: DuckDBPyConnection.execute is a read-only C attribute, so the
            probe cannot wrap it, and a proxy object standing in for the connection would change
            what the builder runs - which a recorder must never do. Module-level entry points
            (duckdb.sql, duckdb.read_parquet) ARE wrapped, because those are patchable and free.

SO ONE EDGE IS DECLARED RATHER THAN OBSERVED, AND SAYS SO
Measured, so the size of the hole is known rather than feared: of 268 builders exactly one imports
duckdb - extract_baci.py - and it opens the BACI archive with Python's own zipfile, so its INPUTS
are observed normally. Only its output is invisible: it writes each member with COPY ... TO. That
single edge is in DECLARED below, is merged into the graph marked `declared` rather than observed,
and is the only edge in this repository that anybody had to write down. The whole point of the
distinction is that it stays visible instead of dissolving into the rest.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
It changes no output and enforces no rule. It runs builders and watches. That is the whole of
phase 1, deliberately: the graph has to be true before anything is built on top of it, and we need
to know which outputs the BACI migration would move BEFORE touching a live finding.

A builder is run in a SUBPROCESS with its own hook, because a builder that calls sys.exit or dies
must not take the recorder with it, and because module-level state must not leak between builders.

RECORDING MUST NOT MUTATE THE REPOSITORY
The first run of this file did. To see what a builder touches you must RUN it, and running 277
builders in alphabetical order ran add_canonicals.py first - it rewrites all 3,695 HTML files -
and then let 200+ page builders overwrite its work. 129 pages silently lost their canonical tags,
favicons, skip-links and clean URLs. Nothing errored. check.py stayed green.

That is the finding, not the accident: THIS REPOSITORY HAS A BUILD ORDER THAT NOTHING ENCODES.
It lives only as knowledge, and knowledge does not survive being run alphabetically.

So the recorder now restores after every builder: tracked files go back via git, files the builder
created are deleted, and the gitignored data stores are snapshotted before the run and compared
after. Observation must leave no trace, or it is not observation.

COST
Running 286 builders is not free and some are slow. --only and --skip-slow exist for that. A
builder that fails is recorded as failed, not silently omitted: an unrecorded builder is itself a
finding, and pretending otherwise would be the green-gate-on-a-lie this project keeps warning about.

# an excuse - the eleven are named in _regressing_builders.json under `hash_seed_dependent`, so the

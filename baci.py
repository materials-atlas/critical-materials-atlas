"""CEPII BACI, the one door. Phase 2 of ARCHITECTURE.md.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
Measured by running every builder under an audit hook: 56 builders open raw/baci/ themselves - 39
unzip the archives, 15 read only the country-code file - and 53 of them hold their own copy of the
country mapping. Twenty carry an identical two-line override dict (Taiwan, and Namibia whose ISO2
"NA" collides with the missing-value sentinel). Identical today by luck: nothing enforces it, and
one correction to that mapping would have to be made in twenty places, which is exactly how the
Republic-of-Congo fix had to be made twice.

So this is the only legal reader of raw/baci/. Everything else reads the extract through it.

WHAT IT SERVES
- countries()   the BACI numeric code -> iso2, iso3, name, with the two overrides applied ONCE.
- year(y)       one archive member as a DataFrame: t, i, j, k, v, q - the whole basket, ~11M rows
                for a recent year - read from extract/baci/<HS>/Y<year>.parquet, not the zip.
                i and j come back as BACI numeric codes; ask for iso='iso3' or 'iso2' to map them.
- years(...)    several, concatenated.
- crm_codes()   the 47 HS6 codes the atlas tracks (out/crosswalk.json, the superset of the
                pipeline's 31), so year(y, codes=crm_codes()) is the cube-grain subset.

WHAT IT PRESERVES, DELIBERATELY
- k is a STRING. HS codes carry leading zeros (010121) and any integer inference destroys them.
- v and q are floats with NULL where BACI wrote the literal NA. Readers that used to test for
  the string "NA" must test isna() instead - the acceptance harness catches any that were missed.
- i and j stay numeric until you ask, because some readers key on the number and some on ISO.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
It does not open a zip. extract_baci.py (top level, one writer) does that, once, and this module
refuses to serve a year that has not been extracted rather than quietly falling back to the
archive - a fallback would be a second door.

# >3x against the same flow's neighbouring years with value roughly unchanged. A flow is repaired
# ONLY when an independent source confirms the repaired level; the rest are listed, not changed.
# The repair is applied by extract_baci.py (the one writer), so every reader sees it, and the
# extract marks the row in q_flag. The repaired q is the flow's value divided by its median unit

"""CEPII BACI: the one writer. Phase 2 of ARCHITECTURE.md.

Turns each archive member (one nomenclature, one year, ~11M rows of t,i,j,k,v,q) into one parquet
file under extract/baci/<HS>/Y<year>.parquet. After this runs, nothing in the repository has a
reason to open a BACI zip, and baci.py is the only thing that opens the extract.

WHY DUCKDB, AND WHY VIA A TEMP FILE
pandas.read_csv on 364 MB of text is slow and memory-hungry; DuckDB streams it. DuckDB reads
paths, not zip members, so each member is streamed to a temp file first and deleted after -
the extract never needs the archive unpacked on disk.

TWO THINGS FORCED, BECAUSE INFERENCE GETS THEM WRONG
- k is VARCHAR. HS6 codes carry leading zeros (010121, 020110). Integer inference would turn
  010121 into 10121 and every join on the code would silently miss.
- The literal string NA is NULL. BACI writes NA where it has no quantity. Twenty-six readers test
  for the string; after migration they test isna(), and the acceptance harness catches any that
  were missed.

VERIFIED PER MEMBER, NOT ASSUMED
Row count against the CSV, count of leading-zero codes preserved, count of NULLs where NA was.
A member that fails verification is deleted, not kept - a partial extract is a second door.

Run:  python extract_baci.py              # all 23 members (~15-25 min)
      python extract_baci.py --only 2024  # one year, for testing or a refresh
      python extract_baci.py --force      # redo members that already exist

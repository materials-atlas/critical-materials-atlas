# the same query (Canada, 31 codes, one month, one flow) returns exactly 500 rows without a key
# and 1,111 with one. Everything Comtrade has contributed to this project so far is therefore
# incomplete by construction - not wrong, but cut off at an arbitrary line with no error and no
# flag. That is very likely part of what looked like two countries disagreeing.
#
# With a free subscription key the limit is 100,000 records per call, which changes the shape of
# the job entirely: 31 codes x 6 months x both flows came back as 10,435 rows in ONE call. The
# whole 18-month backfill is ~114 calls against a 500/day allowance, so it fits in a single run

        fields we do not request and therefore cannot see, such as customs procedure or mode of
        transport - and it returns the aggregate alongside its own components. Canada's December
        2024 coal imports from the USA came back as four rows:

            34.563  +  134,675.909  +  67,717,507.625  =  67,852,218.097

        first-seen `seen` set, so it kept 34.563 - $34 for a shipment of 417,000 tonnes - and
        discarded the real figure. The US side reported $74.6m for the same coal, so the pipeline
        recorded a 2,000,000x "disagreement" between two countries that actually agree to within
        10%.

        That single defect is a large part of why 51% of matched flows appeared to disagree, and
        the number was one day from being published as a finding about world trade statistics.

        Summing is WRONG here - the components are already inside the total, so summing would
        double it. Taking the maximum is right, and provably so on this cell: the largest row

"""Standalone / cron job that GROWS the Comtrade cache — kept out of build.py so builds stay fast.
Comtrade's free tier is strictly rate-limited, so this pulls a small rotation of reporters per run and
appends to comtrade_cache.jsonl; run it occasionally (or on a schedule) and coverage accumulates.

Usage:  python pipeline/pull_comtrade.py [n_reporters]   (default 1; each reporter ~= 6 rate-limited calls)
Then a normal `python pipeline/build.py` folds the accumulated cache into flows.parquet."""

"""SOURCE METADATA — what each compilation actually measures, and why they differ.

The owner's request: "we need the metadata of all sources which will explain in what the difference
consists." Until now that knowledge lived scattered across builder docstrings, SOURCE.md files and
the pairing map's reason strings. A reader comparing two numbers had no single place to learn that
one counts gross ore and the other contained metal.

Two halves, deliberately:
  * COVERAGE is COMPUTED from the cube - years, countries, materials, row counts, measures. It
    cannot go stale, and it cannot flatter the source.
  * INTERPRETATION is WRITTEN. What a compilation means by "production", whose numbers it is
    really carrying, and where it is known to be thin are things a script cannot infer. Each note
    below is a claim we are making and can be held to.

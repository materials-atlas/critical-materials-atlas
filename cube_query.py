"""Ask the cube what it has, before asking it a question.

WHY THIS EXISTS
A query cannot be written blind. "Cobalt production" is not a well-formed request: the cube
holds cobalt mine production from four compilations, in three units, on two bases - BGS in
tonnes of metal content, USGS and World Mining Data in gross tonnes, the IEA in thousand
tonnes. Each is defensible; they are not the same number, and summing across them is nonsense.
So the identity has to be pinned before the join, and pinning it requires knowing what is on
offer. That is what metadata is FOR, and it only does the job if it is machine-readable at the
grain a query actually needs - per material, not per cube.

out/cube_summary.json describes the cube's shape (how many rows, which sources, which years).
It cannot answer "for cobalt, what may I pin?". This module answers exactly that, and then
refuses to run any query that is still ambiguous.

  identities(material=...)     what fact identities exist, with years and coverage
  attributes(material=...)     what material attributes exist, with source and vintage
  facts(...)                   rows for ONE pinned identity - raises, with the menu, if more
                               than one identity survives the filter
  attach(df, attribute, ...)   join an attribute onto facts; refuses if it would fan out

Nothing here silently picks for you. A default that guesses is how a doubled tonnage gets
published without anybody noticing.

Run:  python cube_query.py            # writes out/cube_manifest.json and prints an example

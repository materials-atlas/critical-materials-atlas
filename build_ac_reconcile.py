"""Reconcile the two apparent-consumption methods, and record WHY they differ.

Background. Apparent consumption (refined production + imports - exports) has been computed two
ways: by a dedicated per-metal builder using mirror-reconciled trade, and - since the cube exists -
as a single query over one table. A first comparison appeared to show a 4-point disagreement on
China's share of refined copper (53% vs 57%), which would have been a serious problem: two of our
own methods contradicting each other.

It was not a disagreement. It was a bad query, and instructively so - it broke the exact rule the
pairing map exists to enforce. Filtering production on (material='copper', stage='processed')
silently summed THREE different BGS copper forms as if they were one series, and it compared a 2022
cube figure against a 2023 pipeline figure. Pair the declared form (BGS 'copper, refined') with the
declared code (HS 740311, cathodes) in a single year, and the methods agree to under one point.

The residual difference that remains is real and worth keeping visible:
  * production vintage - the per-metal builder mixes years (production 2022, trade 2024) because it
    takes each component from the latest source available. The cube can be internally consistent at
    one year. The page does disclose the mixed vintage per material, so nothing was hidden.
  * trade source - raw BACI vs mirror-reconciled flows differ by ~5% on China's net refined copper
    trade (3,163 vs 3,347 kt), which moves the share by a few tenths of a point.

"""Build the evidence JSON for the unpublished permanent-magnet chain pilot.

Production, processing, magnet manufacturing and customs trade remain separate.
Run from the repository root: python magnet-chain/record_magnets.py

IT WROTE OVER THE LIVE CHAIN RECORD UNTIL 12 SEP 2026.
This file and record_magnet.py - singular, one letter apart - both wrote out/magnet_chain.json, and
they produce COMPLETELY DIFFERENT documents. record_magnet.py builds the published chain page
(h1, deck, sections, hops, chokepoint) and build_chokepoint_map.py reads it. This one builds a
pilot's evidence tables (bgs_mine_production, usgs_world_production, global_trade). Whichever ran
last won, and nothing said so.

It was found by running it: the chokepoint map immediately failed with "map rows with no record:
['magnet']", because the row it needed had been replaced by a table of mine production. The map
check caught the damage, which is the one piece of luck in the story - had those two documents
shared a few key names, it would have failed silently instead.

The listed defect was real: ARCHITECTURE.md's invariant I2 named record_magnet.py vs
record_magnets.py as one of two double-writer pairs that were "unclear and must be resolved by
reading, not guessed at". This is that resolution. The pilot now writes its own file, so the two
can coexist and the live record cannot be clobbered by running the wrong script.

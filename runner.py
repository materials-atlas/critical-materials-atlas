"""Rebuild what a change invalidates, in dependency order. Phase 3 of ARCHITECTURE.md.

WHAT IT IS FOR
Two failures, both already suffered:

  * THE GERMANIUM CLASS. data.json's germanium refining share was corrected; out/risk.json had
    been built weeks earlier and kept scoring the old value for three weeks. Every file was
    internally valid, so no link check and no schema check could see it. The only signal is
    "an input changed and its consumer did not rebuild" - which is this file.
  * THE 129-PAGE CLASS. The recorder's first pass ran the builders alphabetically, which put
    add_canonicals.py first and let 200 page builders overwrite its work. Nothing errored.
    THE REPOSITORY HAS A BUILD ORDER THAT NOTHING ENCODES - until this file, which encodes it
    as the topological order of the observed graph rather than as a list somebody maintains.

STALENESS IS CONTENT, NEVER TIME
A builder's fingerprint is a hash of its own source, the content of every input nothing else
produces, and - recursively - the fingerprints of the builders that produce its other inputs. So a
change anywhere upstream reaches everything downstream, and a fresh clone (which resets every
mtime) is not spuriously stale. build_cube.py currently derives `retrieved_at` from a file's
mtime, which is the defect class this project has already been bitten by; nothing here repeats it.

Hashing 3.6 GB of raw/ on every invocation would make the tool too slow to use, and a tool nobody
runs is not a guard. So content hashes are CACHED under a (size, mtime) key: if the stat matches,
the stored content hash is reused; if it does not, the file is re-read. The stat is a cache key
only - it never decides staleness, and a wrong stat costs a re-read, not a wrong answer.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
- It will not run a builder that fetches from the network or costs API quota (NEVER_RUN below).
  A stale one of those is REPORTED and the run stops. A silent skip is how a stale cache ships.
- IT WILL NOT REBUILD A PAGE THE BUILDER IS BEHIND. Its first real run rebuilt eighteen builders
  correctly and produced eight pages that were WORSE than the published ones: no favicons, no
  skip-link, the old two-item navigation, and in one case a footer still carrying the repository's
  previous name. None of that lives in any builder - one commit on 28 Aug edited 244 pages and
  added no script, and headlines have been rewritten by hand since. So a rebuild is not obviously
  an improvement, and for 37 builders it is measurably a regression. Those are listed by name in
  _regressing_builders.json, measured by repro_audit.py, and refused here unless --force says
  otherwise. The list shrinks as builders are brought up to their pages; it is not a permanent
  exemption, it is a debt with names on it.
- It will not guess at a cycle. The graph has one real cycle and it is declared below, with the
  measurement that settles it.

Run:  python runner.py                 what is stale, in the order it would rebuild
      python runner.py --explain X     why X is stale
      python runner.py --run           rebuild the stale ones, in order
      python runner.py --from X        treat X as changed; show/run everything downstream
      python runner.py --accept        record the current tree as fresh, running nothing
      python runner.py --run --skip-held   rebuild only what is safe, and nothing fed by a held one
Out:  _runner_state.json (the baseline, committed) and _runner_cache.json (local, gitignored)

         # two post-passes do not depend on each other's CONTENT at all - each inserts a tag

# after it, so whichever runs LAST ends up closest to the charset. The published pages have the

# injected first, then the 28 Aug favicon edit pushed them along. To reproduce a published page the
# rebuild has to make the same choice, so add_head runs last.
#
# Measured, not assumed: with add_head first, 34 pages that otherwise reproduce exactly came back
# byte-for-byte the same LENGTH and a different head order. Nothing was wrong with them; they simply
# were not the published file, and "not the published file" is the whole question I7 asks.
#
# This is a real weakness of an observed graph and is written here rather than hidden: a builder
# that DID something on the day it was recorded gets an edge, and one that found nothing to do does
# not. Only ordering is declared - never a read or a write.

# builder" rule therefore skipped them. It cost three live pages their favicon and their canonical
# within one run, which is the 129-page failure in miniature and was caught only by checking.
#
# The rule is right and the exception is right: it exists because a rebuild fed by a stale input
# bakes a stale NUMBER into a fresh output. These two read no numbers. They insert a tag and leave
# everything else alone, so a held builder's staleness cannot reach their output - and skipping
# them does active harm, which no other skip does.

# A BUILD IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE WHILE SET ITERATION IS RANDOM.
# Python randomises string hashing per process, so any builder that iterates a set - or sorts by a
# value that ties and lets the input order decide - emits a different file every run. Measured, not
# assumed: build_trends.py and build_ot.py each produce three byte-identical outputs with the seed
# pinned, and a different output under a different seed. Eleven builders behave this way.
#
# This is the same fix as pinning gzip's mtime earlier today: the output was never about the data,
# and a build that cannot reproduce itself cannot be checked against anything. It is a floor, not
# an excuse - the eleven are named in _regressing_builders.json under `hash_seed_dependent`, so the
# fragility stays visible. A builder that needs a fixed seed to be stable would still shuffle under
# a different Python, and the real repair is a tiebreak at each site.

    WHY THE PRODUCED FILES ARE HASHED TOO, AND NOT JUST THE PRODUCER'S FINGERPRINT
    The first version took a producer's fingerprint as a complete summary of its output, and that
    is false whenever a file on disk is older than the code that makes it. Found 12 Sep, on the
    germanium share again: out/capability_years.json had been stale for weeks, the baseline had
    been accepted with it stale, and re-running build_feedstock.py by hand fixed the FILE while
    changing nothing about its inputs or its code - so its fingerprint did not move, so
    build_refiners.py never learned, so refiners.html went on publishing the retracted 0.94.

    Both terms are kept because they catch different moments. The producer's fingerprint fires
    BEFORE it runs (its code or inputs changed, so everything downstream is about to change), and
    the content hash fires AFTER (the file on disk is not what the consumer last saw, however it
    got that way - a hand-run, a partial build, a checkout). Either alone leaves a hole.

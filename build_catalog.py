"""THE COVERAGE CATALOG — what data we could use, before we pay to use it.

The owner's question: "can the cube be bigger? Having a rich cube over our scope lets us check
quickly and cheaply whether data exists when a question arises, and whether a new sub-project is
even possible."

The council's answer (Codex): the *idea* is right but full ingestion is a maintenance trap. Build a
catalog of SERIES, not a bigger table of observations. One row per available series with its
geography, year span and parse status. Then feasibility is a lookup, and only series that earn
their place get promoted into cube.parquet.

So this builder answers "do we have data for X?" without normalizing a single extra value.

    status vocabulary
      in_cube   — already ingested and queryable in pipeline/data/cube.parquet
      on_disk   — the file is downloaded and sitting in raw/, but not parsed into the cube
      reachable — a known public series from an institution we already use, not yet fetched
                  (marked unverified: the URL/scope has NOT been re-checked by this script)
      driver    — an ACTIVITY series (country-year), not a mineral quantity. Feeds the
                  consumption model rather than the cube; a non-CC one may be used but never
                  republished.
      declined  — considered and rejected, with the reason. A catalog that only lists what we
                  might use is half a record: free, well-licensed and adjacent is not the same as
                  relevant, and an unwritten refusal gets re-proposed every few months.

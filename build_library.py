"""THE DATA LIBRARY — an index of every external dataset the project holds.

Asked for directly: "even if not in the cube they should be somewhere in the project, save all of
them, and note somewhere we may need them later."

The files already are saved - 3.4 GB across raw/ - but raw/ is gitignored, so the repository knew
nothing about them. A file on one disk with no record of what it is or why it was kept is not an
asset; it is clutter that looks like an asset. This builder writes the record.

  SCANNED   folder, file count, formats, total size, newest file. Computed, so it cannot drift
            from what is actually on disk.
  WRITTEN   what the source is, its licence, and WHY WE MIGHT NEED IT LATER. A script cannot
            infer that, so anything not written up is reported as UNDOCUMENTED rather than
            quietly omitted - which is the pressure that keeps this honest.
  DERIVED   read_by, reaches_cube - taken from out/graph.json, the OBSERVED dependency graph.
            ONE SCOPE LIMIT, stated because it changes what "unread" means: the recorder does not
            run pipeline/, which has its own entry point and whose scripts spend API quota. So a
            folder only the pipeline opens would read as unread. Those are found by SEARCHING THE
            PIPELINE'S SOURCE for the folder name - grep, which is exactly the weaker evidence
            this project rejected for the main graph - and are labelled as such, never merged in
            with the observed readers. Two folders (raw/oecd_itic, raw/_sources) are in that state
            today, and the honest fix is to record the pipeline, not to widen this word.
            Phase 4 of ARCHITECTURE.md: the register answers *what do we hold*, the graph answers
            *what feeds what*, and licences.py answers *what may leave*. Three questions, three
            files, no overlap - so these are never typed here and never stored twice.

WHY DERIVING THIS IS WORTH THE TROUBLE
The `status` column is a human claim ("in cube", "driver", "reference"). The graph is a
measurement. Where they disagree the register now says so: a folder marked *in cube* that no
builder reads is either a stale claim or a deleted reader, and either way somebody should know.
That comparison is the point - a register that only repeats what someone typed cannot catch the
thing a register exists to catch.

Output: DATA_LIBRARY.md (committed - the record survives even though the files do not) and
out/library.json.

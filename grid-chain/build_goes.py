"""Is the transformer's core input diffuse, or is it the tightest node in the grid chain?

WHY THIS EXISTS
The grid chain published a contradiction. Hop 1 listed grain-oriented electrical steel beside
copper and aluminium as "abundant, diversified"; a panel two paragraphs below called it one of
"the real scarcities", made by "a small number of mills". Both cannot be true, and neither was
measured - the chain's own BACI extractor names the GOES codes and its output never contained
them. So the label was written, and the evidence for it was not.

Prompted by a reader flagging Amoah, Brown, Simon, Bazilian & Matisek, "Mineral demand from AI
data centers", Resources Policy 119 (2026) 105970, which reportedly calls GOES a particularly
constrained enabling material. The reference is verified via Crossref; the text is paywalled and
we have NOT read it, so it is recorded as what prompted the check, never as evidence for the
result. The result below is ours.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS NOT
HS 722511 (grain-oriented, >=600mm) and 722611 (<600mm) are clean codes. Every group here is
measured identically - same source, same years, same basis - because the question is comparative:
does GOES belong in the same bucket as copper and aluminium?

Trade is not capacity. Export shares say who SELLS, not who can MAKE: a producer that consumes
its own output at home is understated, and China is exactly that. Some listed exporters are
distribution hubs re-selling other mills' steel. So the concentration computed here is a FLOOR on
the real thing, and the direction of the error is known.
